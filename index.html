              I am Khushaank Gupta, and I am a Student of
              <a href="">CA.</a> This is my personal homepage.
            </p>
            <p>
              I <strong>enjoy</strong> learning about finance, trading, and
              capital markets. My journey as a CA student has allowed me to
              explore these areas in depth. Alongside academics, I am always
              curious about startups and innovations in the financial world, and
              I aspire to contribute to society with the knowledge and skills I
              gain.
            </p>
            <p>
              Outside studies, I particularly enjoy listening to music, playing
              instruments, working out, spending time with friends and family,
              and exploring new experiences. I love playing sports, staying fit,
              and enjoy all kinds of music that inspire me to grow and relax.

            <p>
              In school, I was not the best student academically, but I was
              always curious. I discovered trading and finance early in my life,
              which gave me direction. I have faced challenges, but every step
              has taught me valuable lessons that continue to shape my journey
              today.

            </p>
            <p>
              I started exploring the world of finance more seriously in my late
              teens. Over time, I began to understand the importance of
              discipline, patience, and continuous learning. With support from
              friends and mentors, I decided to pursue Chartered Accountancy to
              build a strong foundation for my future.

            <p>
              I have always believed in doing things differently, questioning
              conventional methods, and seeking simple and transparent
              solutions. This mindset helps me not only in my studies but also
              in the way I approach challenges in life.
            </p>
            <p>
              However, my true growth started when I surrounded myself with
              like-minded people and mentors who inspired me to work harder. I
              continue to learn from every interaction and try to improve myself
              every day.

            <p>
              My journey is still just beginning. I aim to create a career where
              I can apply my knowledge of finance, contribute to building
              meaningful businesses, and inspire others who may be starting from
              scratch just like me.
            </p>
            <p>
              I am also deeply interested in financial literacy and education. I
              believe sharing knowledge can empower others to make better
              decisions in life and markets, and I want to contribute to that
              space in the future.
            </p>
            <p>
              Along this journey, I am grateful to my family, friends, and
              mentors who have supported me at every stage and encouraged me to
              stay true to my goals.

            <p>
              I am lucky to be surrounded by motivated peers and a positive
              environment that keeps me moving forward. I enjoy discussions,
              debates, and sharing ideas, which help me grow as a learner and an
              individual.
            </p>
            <p>
              Today, I am focused on building strong knowledge and character as
              a CA student. I believe in slow and steady growth, backed by
              discipline, effort, and continuous improvement. With time, I hope
              to create value and make an impact in whichever field I choose to
              pursue.
            </p>
            <p>
              For me, success is not just about titles or money, but about
              staying consistent, enjoying the journey, and creating something
              meaningful and sustainable. I believe growth comes from effort,
              patience, and a bit of luck too.
